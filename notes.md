In HTML, you can use \<div\> to separate diferent areas of a screen verically. \<a href=link\> will insert a hyperlink in the text provided after the identifier. Images are similar, except it's \<img src=location\>. Add style=width:#px; for specific size.

Input fields can have labels with label for="id" of the input field. Input fields are typed, can have id, need a name and value.
